			<h2>Wires and detective work</h2>
			<h3>GM, 2.27.16</h3>
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, LP, RS and GM connected all known (15 or so) cables between the units. We left one ground wire because we did not find a good spot for it, will do with more time.</p> 
			
			<p>Today, we looked at the orange controller on top and launched the hypothesis that it contains updated control electronics for the scope. It, and the black vacuum controller, were added significantly later than the initial purchase. We also know from the eBay picture that the orange control unit had the little gray sample amplifier sitting behind the specimen current module (all the way on the right as seen from the back). We are not sure what is connected to what there.

			<h2>Hose work</h2>
			<h3>LP, 4.15.16</h3>
			
			
			<p>We took the black hoses going to the pump array off and drained them; from the perspective of facing the hose nozzles, the hose on the left had oil in it, while the other had water. We then attached the two cut gray rubber hoses to the nozzles and tightened them with the hose clamps.</p>
